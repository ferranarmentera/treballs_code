/*------------------Understanding format strings------------------------------
A variable or expression can be formatted using a format string after a comma or
colon.
An N0 format string means a number with thousand separators and no decimal places,
while a C format string means currency. The currency format will be determined by the
current thread. For instance, if you run this code on a PC in the UK, you'll get pounds
sterling with commas as the thousand separators, but if you run this code on a PC in
Germany, you would get Euros with dots as the thousand separators.
The full syntax of a format item is:
{ index [, alignment ] [ : formatString ] }
Each format item can have an alignment, which is useful when outputting tables
of values, some of which might need to the left- or right-aligned within a width of
characters. Alignment values are integers. Positive integers are right-aligned and
negative integers are left-aligned.
For example, to output a table of fruit and how many of each there are, we might
want to left-align the names within a column of 8 characters and right-align the
counts formatted as numbers with zero decimal places within a column of six
characters.
