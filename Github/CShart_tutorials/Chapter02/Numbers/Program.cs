// Numbers can be natural numbers, such as 42, used for counting (also called whole
// numbers); they can also be negative numbers, such as -42 (called integers); or, they
// can be real numbers, such as 3.9 (with a fractional part), which are called single or
// double-precision floating point numbers in computing.

// Good Practice: Use int for whole numbers and double for real
// numbers that will not be compared to other values. Use decimal
// for money, CAD drawings, general engineering, and wherever
// accuracy of a real number is important.
